I'm going to take this down by the spot. Four o'clock here. I'm going to take the white. Yeah, I'm going to take the three-seven-ones call, please. Two-one-hundred-two. It's the officer on the phone with the caller. Can you hear me? I'm going to take the white. I'll have the five-nile-one right here.
