I was able to make contact with him. The nine-year-old's home, he was just out of front, so he was cleared out. Copy. That suspicious person left. Try it for my arrival. All right, 1235 Bridge over at Moe's Restaurant. You can see an Uber driver there. There's a little bit of a language barrier. We think he just might be lost.
